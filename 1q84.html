			<p id="book-desc">1Q84 is a novel by Haruki Murakami that blends fantasy, mystery, and romance in a parallel world
				that resembles Tokyo in the year 1984. The novel follows the lives of two protagonists, Aomame and Tengo, who
				are childhood friends but have lost contact with each other. Aomame is a fitness instructor and a secret
				assassin who kills abusive men. Tengo is a math teacher and an aspiring writer who gets involved in rewriting a
				mysterious manuscript by a teenage girl named Fuka-Eri. The manuscript, titled Air Chrysalis, describes a cult
				and its leader, who can communicate with beings called Little People. As Aomame and Tengo pursue their separate
				missions, they realize that they have entered a different reality, which Aomame calls 1Q84, where there are two
				moons in the sky and the Little People have a sinister agenda. They also discover that they are connected by a
				powerful bond that transcends time and space, and that they must find each other before it is too late. The
				novel is a complex and imaginative exploration of the themes of identity, fate, love, and violence.</p>
