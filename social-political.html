			<p id="book-desc">Contemporary Social and Political Theory: An Introduction is a book by Fidelma Ashe et al. that
				provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the main theoretical perspectives and debates in social and
				political thought since the 1960s. The book examines the impact and implications of new ideas such as feminist
				theory, poststructuralism, hermeneutics, and critical theory, as well as the challenges they pose to the
				traditional paradigms of liberalism, Marxism, and rationalism. The book also explores the connections and
				conflicts between different theories, as well as their relevance for understanding contemporary issues such as
				democracy, identity, power, and justice. The book is designed to be accessible and engaging for students, with
				key concepts, examples, summaries, questions, and suggestions for further reading. The book is suitable for
				undergraduate and postgraduate courses in sociology, politics, philosophy, and related disciplines, as well as
				anyone interested in learning more about the current state of social and political theory.
